    My name is Stevenson and I am a computer science and mathematics student at Berea College. With a strong proficiency in programming languages like Python and C++, and web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am aiming to land a career in Software Engineering or Data Science. I am particularly fascinated by Machine Learning and AI, as I interpret those as a new layer in the world's technological evolution using a variety of mathematical inputs. I hope to secure an internship this summer, which will complement my learning with hands-on experience in the computer science as well as with connections to some bright minds in the field.
